Building a BM25 Retrieval model on PubMed's Covid-19  Dataset

Covid-19 Research Paper Search Engine Design

Background
Advancements in natural language processing and information retrieval will be essential in allowing researchers to access data with increased accessibility. 
Research databases are preferred in academic circles as they provide more reliable and relevant results to users.
Research on the Covid-19 virus has increased a lot in the past two years. By implementing a search engine for Covid-19 research papers, new researchers and scientists can easily find the most relevant and the most recent research on the virus and use that information for studying further.
Objective
To examine the use of a domain-specific retrieval model in coronavirus literature, in comparison with other models, and evaluate the indexing and performance of the models.

BM25 Retrieval model
We have developed a BM25 Okapi model for query-based document retrieval using covid research papers from the PubMed repository. The indexing framework will consist of the following -
1. Loading
2. Cleaning
3. Stop word removal
4. Tokenization
5. Vectorization
Our retrieval model will use BM25 on the index. From this, we collect information from each document and categorize them.
